# Closure Chain

⛓️ Chain of responsibility pattern for your Closures.

> In object-oriented design, the from-of-responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects.[1] Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the from. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this from. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern
